# 💫 About Me:
I am currently working at TCS as a Java Developer on a Transportation and Logistics project, focusing on backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs, building scalable and high-performance systems.<br>I am looking to collaborate on Java backend projects, microservices, and transportation/logistics software solutions, contributing to real-world enterprise applications or open-source projects.<br>I am looking for help with mastering system design, microservices best practices, and advanced backend architecture to further optimize scalable applications.<br>I am currently learning cloud-native backend development, Kafka for event-driven systems, and performance optimization techniques for distributed systems.<br>Ask me about Java, Spring Boot, microservices, REST APIs, and building backend systems for transportation and logistics domains.<br>I enjoy debugging tricky backend issues almost as much as solving real-world logistics puzzles, and I treat every bug like a fun challenge.
